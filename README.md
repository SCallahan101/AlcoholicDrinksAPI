Here's my Alcoholic API Project

My project focus was to use an API and bring it out to my best abilities. The idea came to me when the pandemic cause stay-home orders. So, I was trying to be creative and design the App to give the users a place to look up drink ideas. The API structure was not perfect, but it was available and free. I want to show off my skills during the project work where I have worked around the obstacles. Also, bring out some creativity and design-eyes while using jQuery.

There are several pages for users to play around with: Search Form, Specific ingredient, Prefer Alcohol Base, Popular Drinks, and Randomized Drink. Each page gives the user the small capability to look around in a hard, easy, or explore around, whichever suits them. 

I noticed that the API isn't perfect where it is occasionally not working due to API calls not working smoothly. Just the same with its' data structure where I have to do compress data into an array. So I can bring them out all together somehow.

This project includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery. 

Ex: Front page

The front page composed several features - Search Engine, Popular drinks selection, Ingredients selection, Alcohol Bases selection, and Randomize drink. I am trying to provide the audience of users an opportunity to find or discover an alcoholic drink that may interest them. Since the pandemic started and we all are trying new stuff and looking for something new to try out. This API provides a good range of drinks to be discovered. Also, at the same time, I want to improve my skills with self-navigating with the API while using jQuery as a good practice. 


Ex: The list of drinks shown from the database
