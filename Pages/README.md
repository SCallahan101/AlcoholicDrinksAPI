Here's my Alcoholic API Project

My project focus was to use an API and bring it out to my best abilities. The idea came to me when the pandemic cause stay-home orders. So, I was trying to be creative and design the App to give the users a place to look up drink ideas. The API structure was not perfect, but it was available and free. I want to show off my skills during the project work where I have worked around the obstacles. Also, bring out some creativity and design-eyes while using jQuery.

There are several pages for users to play around with: Search Form, Specific ingredient, Prefer Alcohol Base, Popular Drinks, and Randomized Drink. Each page gives the user the small capability to look around in a hard, easy, or explore around, whichever suits them. 

I noticed that the API isn't perfect where it is occasionally not working due to API calls not working smoothly. Just the same with its' data structure where I have to do compress data into an array. So I can bring them out all together somehow.
